# CMS HB Phase 1 Upgrade database.
A web-framework for the CMS HB Phase 1 Upgrade database.
Initial QIE Card testing was performed at Fermilab, Summer 2016. QIE stands for "charge integrator and encoder."
Readout Modules (RM) and Calibration Units (CU) were assembled at CERN, Fall 2016.

## Initial Teststands at Fermilab
### 1. Firmware programming of Bridge and Igloo Field Programable Gate Arrays (FPGA).
### 2. Quality control (QC) tests of read/writes to all registers and micro HCAL Trigger and Readout (uHTR) tests.
### 3. Calibration of QIE Chips using DC current charge injection.
## Reaout Box (RBX)
Each Readout Box (RBX) contains 4 Readout Modules (RM), 17 QIE Cards, 4 SiPM Control Cards, 1 Pulser Card and 1 Calibration Unit (CU).
Each RBX has 4 MTP cabels, 32 data fibers, 192 channels, 192 Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM), and 192 Bias Voltages (BV).
There are 4 "dark SiPM channels" that do not receive data.
## Readout Modules (RM)
There are 4 Reaout Modules (RM) per Readout Box (RBX). Each RM contains 4 QIE Cards and 1 SiPM Control Card. Thus each RM has 48 QIE Chips, 48 channels, 8 fibers within 1 MTP cable, and 48 Bias Voltages (BV) which are set by the SiPM Control Card.
## QIE Cards
There are 4 QIE Cards per Readout Module (RM) and 16 QIE Cardsin in RMs per Readout Box (RBX). Each QIE Card has 12 QIE Chips, 12 channels, and 2 fibers. Note that each fiber has 6 channels.
## SiPM Control Cards
There is 1 SiPM Control Card per Readout Module (RM) and 4 SiPM Control Cards per Readout Box (RBX). Each SiPM Control Card controls 48 Bias Voltages (BV) for 48 Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM).
## Calibrations Units (CU)
There is 1 Calibration Unit (CU) per Readout Box (RBX). Each CU contains 1 Pulser Board and 1 QIE Card. The CU has 6 pindioes and 5 laster inputs. The center quatz fiber input provides light for 2 pindioes as well as all SiPMs in RBX for a laser run.
